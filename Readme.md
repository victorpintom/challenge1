# As Rich as Croesus – Wealth-tech solution for Canadians’ financial advisors 
## Overview and Origin: 
* Remy Therrien was pondering what these last 36 years have meant for the company he founded and leads. Sitting in his recently inaugurated new headquarters in Laval, Quebec, he reflected on the changes and challenges that his company and its industry are facing. With almost 200 employees today, his company’s beginnings in the financial technology space were as humble as the name it once had.

* Back in 1987, a young 20-year-old Remy, still a student in engineering physics, founded, together with his then partner Carol Jean, Unigiciel. The company’s name was a French made-up word meaning “One Software”. The purpose of that early version of the company was to develop a computer tool that would allow Carol, an investment advisor at Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion, to manage his client’s accounts. 

* Soon, working from the proverbial basement, Remy created their first product, a beta version in DOS language of the software. Two years later, in 1989, the first marketable version of the software was presented to investment advisors under the name Croesus, after the wealthiest king in ancient Greece. 

* It took the startup three years to sign a contract with their first major client, Lévesque Beaubien Geoffrion, now National Bank. 

* The adoption was slow but other institutions took notice and became clients such as Desjardins in 1996. Breaking from their French-Canadian roots proved difficult, but they managed to make the jump into English-Canada and landed CIBC in 2010 and TD in 2013. 

* In parallel, the technological developments kept evolving. Over the years, the company incorporated a SaaS-model version of the flagship software and added more functionalities and modules to portfolio management. Tax accounting, unified managed accounts and segregated managed accounts, data analytics and business intelligence tools were added over time. 

* Early on, with the high recognition of its flagship product, the company was renamed Croesus. 

* The company also grew inorganically by acquiring softTarget in 2019, a specialist in portfolio rebalancing and investment compliance. 

* Croesus has grown mainly by bootstrapping and being self-sustainable. Remy is the majority shareholder in the firm.   

## Business Activities:
* Croesus is a wealth-tech firm focused on providing wealth management solutions. It has two main products: Croesus Advisor and Croesus Central.

* Croesus Advisors is a one-stop platform for portfolio management. It provides investment professionals with productivity-enhancing tools and client-relationship management features such as an investment report generator, modeling and calculation tools, historical data loader and order management system. 

* Croesus Central is an automated portfolio rebalancing tool for investment managers. The main features of this solution are automated task management of time-sensitive tasks, rebalancing considering mandate, compliance and tax optimization, buy-sell order aggregator, modelling and what-if scenario engine generator. 

* Croesus products are directed to the advisors and portfolio managers that serve the end clients who are asset owners. The following graph show the different client types that Croesus attends.

* The solution that Croesus provides is for efficient portfolio management and rebalancing. They offer wealth management advisors and professionals to increase their productivity by facilitating the accurate gathering of client portfolio data with very amicable client-facing tools powered by sophisticated software data back-processing solutions. For instance, Croesus Central not only considers fiscal optimization at time of portfolio rebalancing but also monitors and resolves any compliance or regulatory breach.

* According to Stackshare, a community-driven SaaS platform that shows which software tools are being used by companies, Croesus three business tools (Jira, Confluence and InVision), nine DevOps tools (Git, npm, Visual Studio, Selenium, Bower, Azure DevOps, HAProxy, Nagios and LXC) and 10 Application and Data tools (JavaScript, Node.js, HTML5, Google Drive, Apache HTTP Serv, C#, AngularJS, CentOS, Polymer and Mono).

## Landscape
* The wealthtech industry seeks to provide software that facilitates the management of wealth in aspects such as finding new clients, providing advice, and building investment portfolios while managing risk and regulations.  

* Croesus is hardly alone in the Canadian wealthtech space. As of Q1-2023, there were six major verticals identified in the Canadian wealthtech industry: Analytics, Client Engagement/Sales, Financial Planning, Robo-Advisor/Consumer, Risk/Compliance, and Portfolio Management/Platforms. In this latter category, Croesus competes with 17 other providers. 

![Alt text](<7. Canadian Wealthtech map 2023.png>)
* The wealthtech industry in Canada has evolved at a rapid pace. Part of this growth stems from the natural protection that the industry receives from the complex Canadian taxation and regulatory environment. For instance, a U.S. wealthtech company, wanting to compete in Canada, would not only need to develop a good understanding of the specifics of taxation of wealth management products (RRSPs, TFSAs, FHSAs, etc), but also would need to incorporate in its offering the different regulations, in some case at the provincial levels, that are required to be maintained not only for best client service but also to comply with regulatory bodies avoiding in some cases hefty fines. Hence, once a wealthtech has a contract with a company, the switching costs and risks to shift are too high. 

* These regulatory and tax moats have allowed Croesus to maintain a high market share. Nonetheless, there are risks imposed by new well-backed VC-funded players that could carve out portions of its business. For instance, wealthtech companies that provide AI solutions for advisors or whose dashboards and data fronts are more appealing to clients. The advent of robo-advisors could also disrupt entirely the industry from its core, reducing the number of professional advisors.  

* The ultimate client that the financial planner serves is also becoming more sophisticated and requires more complex products and solutions. Clients now demand access to ESG investment products, alternative products, cryptocurrencies and digital assets, or even tax management products such as flow-through shares and limited partnerships. These products must be made readily available and need to be shown to clients as part of their overall portfolios in a very friendly easy-to-understand, omni-channel accessible dashboard. 

* Further, as the new generations inherit wealth, their technological savvy will require a different approach in their investment and financial planning. The Investor Economics Household Balance Sheet Report – Canada 2017 estimated that approximately CAD 1 trillion in wealth will go into generational change between 2016 and 2026. Accenture, a consulting firm, in its 2017 Millenials and Money report, concluded that this client group will demand and accept robo-generated recommendations, will prefer gamification to learn about investing, will refer to social media for investment recommendations and will be all-the-time and everywhere connected to sources of data.

* A major game changer in the wealthtech industry is AI. Potentially, it could eliminate the advisor from the financial planning equation although a major change in regulation and certification would have to happen first. In Canada, financial planners need to pass extensive examination in order to be certified. Nonetheless, AI could reduce or eliminate routine, or objective, tasks such as portfolio rebalancing, asset mix optimization or the creation of financial projections, allowing advisors to focus on subjective tasks such as relationship management and client advisory when turbulence hits the markets and clients want to change course based on emotional responses. The table below shows the tasks that are more suitable for machines and which ones are for humans.

* New players applying AI to the wealthtech industry are potential market disruptors. One of Croesus key competitors is Conquest Planning. Conquest, out of Winnipeg, Manitoba, provides AI powered software to digitally assist financial professionals in delivering personalized portfolio planning solutions for their clients. 

* Founded in 2018 by fintech veterans and backed by Fidelity, Portage, BNY Mellon and RBC, Conquest raised, in its last round C$ 24m, bringing total funding as of Q1 2023 up to C$ 35m. 

* Conquest users include IG Wealth Management, Sun Life, Canada Life, Investment Planning Counsel, Worldsource, Canadian Western Bank, Wellington-Altus and CG Wealth Management.

* According to Mark Evans, Founder and CEO, Conquest rapidly has reached over 15,000 advisors in Canada as of 2022.

## Results
* Croesus has managed to achieve a significant market share in the Canadian wealth management space. 

* As of today, Croesus is living up to its name synonym with wealth. It has 15,000 financial advisors that use its software, who in turn manage CAD 1.7 trillion in end-client assets representing a 55% market share of the AUM of the Canadian wealth management industry. The over three-decades-old fintech/wealth-tech firm is still evolving at the same speed as the technology that powers its products.

* Since companies in the space are mostly private there are no public key performance indicator, whether financial or operational, that could provide a glimpse of their success or efficiency as market participants. However, the impressive AUM market share of Croesus is a testament to the penetration of its solution and of its success in Canada.

## Recommendations

* Croesus has managed to achieve what many Canadian companies could not, staying alive for decades in the fintech/wealthtech space. This is a combination of being early in the market and maintaining an ear close to the clients and an eye close to competition. However, if Croesus would like to continue growing it must make significant changes.

* User experience (UX) is a key aspect of any software offered to the market. While Croesus has gained the trust of thousands of advisors, there are other offerings that show a UX more attuned with times and less looking like old banking software. A comparison of sample screens from Croesus solution vs that of rival Conquest shows this difference:

* Croesus screen shot.

* Conquest screen shot.

![Alt text](<12. Conquest screenshot.png>)
* Beyond UX, Conquest is a web-based solution as opposed to an app sitting in a financial advisor device. Croesus should consider providing a similar web-based solution.

* Also, Croesus should incorporate AI and Machine Learning technologies into their portfolio analysis and recommendations. New players, such as Conquest, could leapfrog Croesus by intensively using these technologies. It is noticeable that Conquest, that has only been in the market for 5 years, has reached the same number of financial planning advisors, 15,000, as Croesus, who has been in the market for 36 years. Of note, the AUM managed by the Croesus 15,000 strong financial advisors is larger than that of Conquest’s.

* Finally, Croesus must incorporate crypto and other alternative assets within the possible portfolio solutions it offers to track. As clients demand these products, Croesus should evolve its offering as well.   

* The changes and challenges facing Remy and his company Croesus are many. However, by constantly evolving its offering with the latest technological developments, he can make sure to maintain an increase the moat it has created against its competitors. As king Croesus himself, Croesus the wealthtech company, can go on in history as a synonym for riches for itself and for its clients.
